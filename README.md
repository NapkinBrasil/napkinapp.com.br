Website of our startup

###### We think that all people can do better things, each one of your way!

And this is one of our contribution. It was through this thought that we founded this startup, to try unit people to make difference, to use your knowledge to collaborate and develop new things that matter.

##What're we using?

Here we are using [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).

To facilitate the development and make things quickly, we also use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to run our tasks and [Bower](http://bower.io/) to install all dependencies on the project.

We hope you enjoy!

##Project Structure

The project structure is easy to understand. It's organized in this way:

```
.
|-- assets
|-- bower_components
|-- dist
|-- fonts
|-- scss
`-- CNAME
`-- comeco.html
`-- faq.html
`-- Gruntfile.js
`-- index.html
`-- LICENSE
`-- package.json
```

###assets

You will find archives that are outside a framework or a tool. Like images and fonts that are necessary to website work correctly

###bower_components

Here we have all packages installed using bower. On this folder you will find bootstrap, jQuery and also some other cools packages.

###dist

On this we have the compiled SASS and JS.

###scss

Here are the pure SASS files. If you want to modify any layout of the website, it's here that you have to work.
